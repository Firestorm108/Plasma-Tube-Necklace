# Plasma-Tube-Necklace
A rectifier tube plasma necklace!
It utilizes a dual 18650 setup + boost circuit to power a mosfet-based driver to the flyback transformer. This steps up the voltage into high frequency AC, which is then fed into the vacuum tube. This should create a quiet purple and orange glow. Or, if there happens to be some sort of noble gas inside it could glow a different color.
